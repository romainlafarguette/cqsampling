# Sampling from Conditional Quantiles via Inverse Transform Sampling and Uncrossing

Python module to sample from a set of potentially crossing conditional quantiles

The sampling uses a very simple inverse transform sampling approach

The quantile uncrossing part offers two approaches, based on:

Chernozhukov et al. (2010) Quantile and Probability Curves Without Crossing, Econometrica

Schmidt and Zhu (2016), Quantile Spacings: A Simple Method for the Joint Estimation of Multiple Quantiles Without Crossing
